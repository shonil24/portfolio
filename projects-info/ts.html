    onload or query ready function or any other function didn't work
    As a final resort, timer was set for dynamic loading of content after proj.html/css/js template is loaded.

    proj.html executes after all tags are executed. Due to load function usage its necessary that onload function is used for all completion. THis just starts the execution but elements take time for loading

We found trend and seasonality in time series, ACF and PACF plots which confirmed the non-stationarity. Through seasonal and non-seasonal differencing we eliminated the seasonality and trend except for 2 or 3 significant lags. ADF and Shapiro Wilk test were used to verify the stationarity and normality of Cafe Time Series. ");
